# Breaking Warning

## Overview

This is a mod for the game of Don't Starve Together which is available in the Steam Workshop. 

Being annoyed by someone jumping into your server and destroying everything you built when you were not near your base.

Now you can get the announcement message the minute he/she doing something bad, such as hammering or lighting your structures.

BTW, it will also print the user id of the doer in the server log so that you can ban he/she manually.

## Changelog

**List of tweaks I made for version 1.1**

- Add a option to turn off announcement, which means it only print it in the log file.
